## Sleep.R contains the commands to source "Student's Sleep Data", describe the central tendency and variance of it main variable - extra	 numeric	 increase in hours of sleep, and visualize the difference between control group and experiment group using boxplot.
## UKDriverDeaths.R contains the commands to source "UK Driver Deaths", describe the central tendency and variance of number of deaths and percentage of deaths, and compare the fluctutions of the two variables using line charts.
