### Hertie MPP-E1180 Pair Assignment 1 ###
### By Laurence (Github ID: laurencehendry) & Claire (Github ID: bctclc) ###

# Claire created the "Collaborative Data Analysis Assignment1" branch. 
# Laurence has submitted a simple pull request to change the title of Claire's file "UKDriverDeaths".  
# We chose to investigate two pre-installed dataframes on R: "Student's Sleep Data" and "UKDriverDeaths". The first step to
# quickly understand how the dataframe has been coded and described is to enter "?sleep". 
# Following this we enter commands to gather some descriptive statistics on our data.
# Finally, Laurene enters a command to use another dataframe ("data-link") to Claire's file.
